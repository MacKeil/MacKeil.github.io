            <h1>about me</h1>
            <p class="text-center">I am a motivated web and Android developer. I been developing my web development skills for the last few years. My specialty lies in using the LAMP stack and the MEAN stack. I have experience working on databases using both SQL and No-SQL databases like MongoDB. My work focuses on mobile first design and utiliezes a variety of frameworks from Bootstrap to Bulma. This focus allows me to create beautiful sites quickly. When developing Android apps I focus on the usefulness to the user first, making apps that people actually want to use.</p>

	    <p><a href="https://MacKeil.github.io/ListApp"><img src="./ListAppSmall.jpg" alt="This would be the thumbnail" class="thumbnail"/></a>
    <p>his was a RESTful web app that allowed users to create lists and check off items as done as they go. It was built using the LAMP stack. <a href="https://bulma.io" style="text-decoration: none;">Bulma</a> was used as the front end framework for development. Most of the user actions are taken care of using AJAX calls. I chose to avoid using the fetch API because I wanted this project to work on older browsers. <br><br> <i><b>Future Plans:</b></i><br><b>Implement groups to make the lists "Social"<br>Develop into a Progressive Web App</b>

	    <h2>CoffeeTime!</h2>
	    <p><a href="https://MacKeil.github.io/CoffeeTimeApp"><img src="./CoffeeTimeScreenShot.jpg" alt="Screen Shots of the CoffeeTime! app" class="thumbnail"/></a>This app was my first attempt at Android Development. I kept the app simple, and added features over time. The app has three activities that all tell the user how best to make themselves a good cup of coffee. Each activity is complete with a timer that will allow the user to make an accurate guess of how long to wait for their type of coffee to brew. I added AdMob support with an interstitial ad just for fun (and to learn about how they work).
